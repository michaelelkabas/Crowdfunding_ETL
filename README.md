# Crowdfunding_ETL

For the ETL mini project, you will work with a partner to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After you transform the data (ETL_Mini_Project_2ElkabasM.ipynb or ETL_Mini_Project_HeidiChang.ipynb）, you'll create four CSV files and use the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, you’ll upload the CSV file data into a Postgres database.

Since this is a one-week project, make sure that you have done at least half of your project before the third day of class to stay on track.

Although you and your partner will divide the work, it’s essential to collaborate and communicate while working on different parts of the project. Be sure to check in with your partner regularly and offer support.

1. Inspect the four CSV files (campaign.csv, category.csv, contacts.csv, subcategory.csv), and then sketch an ERD of the tables by using QuickDBDLinks to an external site:https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/#/d/IN5CRU.

2. Use the information from the ERD to create a table schema for each CSV file.

Note: Remember to specify the data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.

3. Save the database schema as a Postgres file named crowdfunding_db_schema.sql, and save it to your GitHub repository.

4. Create a new Postgres database, named crowdfunding_db.

5. Using the database schema, create the tables in the correct order to handle the foreign keys.

6. Verify the table creation by running a SELECT statement for each table.

7. Import each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.

Verify that each table has the correct data by running a SELECT statement for each.
